Product Assignment
==================

Products may have assignments indicating processes that operate upon the product. An example of such assignment is a task to construct a wall.

```
concept {
    IfcProduct:ReferencedBy -> IfcRelAssignsToProduct:RelatingProduct
    IfcRelAssignsToProduct:RelatedObjects -> IfcObject:HasAssignments
    IfcRelAssignsToProduct:RelatedObjects[binding="Type"]
}
```
