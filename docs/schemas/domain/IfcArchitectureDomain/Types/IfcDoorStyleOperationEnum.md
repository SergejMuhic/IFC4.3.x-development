# IfcDoorStyleOperationEnum

This enumeration defines the basic ways to describe how doors operate.

> HISTORY  New enumeration in IFC2x.

Note:

1. Figures are shown in the ground view.
2. Figures (symbolic representation) depend on the national building code.
3. These figures/ are only shown as illustrations, the actual representation in the ground view might differ.
4. Open to the outside is declared as open into the direction of the positive y-axis, determined by the _ObjectPlacement_ at _IfcDoor_
5. The location of the panel relative to the wall thickness is defined by the _ObjectPlacement_ at _IfcDoor_, and the _IfcDoorLiningProperties.LiningOffset_ parameter.
