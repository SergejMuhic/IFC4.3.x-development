# IfcEllipse

An _IfcEllipse_ is a curve consisting of a set of points whose distances to two fixed points add to the same constant.

The inherited _SELF\IfcConic.Position.Location_ is the center of the _IfcEllipse_, and the inherited S_ELF\IfcConic.Position.Position.P[1]_ is the direction of the _SemiAxis1_.

Figure 1 &mdash; Ellipse placement and parameterization

Definition of the <em>IfcEllipse</em> within the a three-dimensional position coordinate system is shown in Figure 1.

It is placed within the object coordinate system of an element of which it is a
representation.

## Attributes

### SemiAxis1
The first radius of the ellipse which shall be positive. Placement.Axes[1] gives the direction of the SemiAxis1.

### SemiAxis2
The second radius of the ellipse which shall be positive.
