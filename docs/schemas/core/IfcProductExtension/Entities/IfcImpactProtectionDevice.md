# IfcImpactProtectionDevice

A impact protection device is a component used to protect other built elements from kinetic damage. impact protection devices currently come in different varieties:
- A vibration damper used to minimize the effects of vibration in a structure by dissipating kinetic energy. The damper may be passive (elastic, frictional, inertia) or active (in a system using sensors and actuators).
- A vibration isolator is a device used to minimize the effects of vibration transmissibility in a structure.
- Impact devices that dissipate kinetic energy from impacting elements (such as vehicles) by deformation or elastic mechanics.
