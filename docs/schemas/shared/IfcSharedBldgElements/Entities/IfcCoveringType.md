# IfcCoveringType

The element type _IfcCoveringType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of coverings. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material (layer set) information
* common shape representations

It is used to define an covering specification or covering style (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Covering types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcCoveringType_ are represented by instances of _IfcCovering_

Informal Propositions:

1. The material assignment, if provided using the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship, shall not reference _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ or _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined types to define the particular type of the covering. There may be property set definitions available for each predefined type.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Layer Set

The material of the IfcCoveringType is defined by IfcMaterialLayerSet for layer-based coverings or as fall back by IfcMaterial and attached by the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial. It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

### Material Profile Set

The material of the IfcCoveringType is defined by IfcMaterialProfileSet for profile-based coverings or as fall back by IfcMaterial and attached by the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial. It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

### Type Body Geometry

The IfcCoveringType may define the shared geometric representation for all covering occurrences. The RepresentationMaps attribute refers to a list of IfcRepresentationMap's, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with IfcShaperepresentation's having an RepresentationIdentifier 'Box', 'Surface', or 'Body'). (See geometric use definition of IfcCovering for further information).

> NOTE  If the IfcCoveringType has an associated IfcMaterialLayerSet, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE  The product shape representations are defined as RepresentationMaps (attribute of the supertype IfcTypeProduct), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an IfcMappedItem. See IfcTypeProduct for further information.

> NOTE  The values of attributes RepresentationIdentifier and RepresentationType of IfcShapeRepresentation are restricted in the same way as those for IfcCoveringType.
