# IfcColumnType

The element type _IfcColumnType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of columns. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations

It is used to define a column specification, or column style (i.e. the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that column type). Column types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcColumnType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_, or its applicable subtypes.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a column element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Profile Set

The material of the IfcColumnType is defined by the IfcMaterialProfileSet or as fall back by IfcMaterial and attached by the IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial. It is accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an IfcMaterialProfileSet (see material use definition above).  The IfcMaterialProfile refers to the subtype of IfcProfileDef that is the common profile for all column occurrence, if used. If an IfcMaterialProfileSet is used, all occurrences of _IfcColumn_ must have a corresponding IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage.

> NOTEÂ  The attribute ProfileName of the IfcProfileDef subtype, referenced in IfcMaterialProfile should contain a standardized profile name according to local standards. However, an additional geometric representation of the profile is necessary (e.g. as IfcExtrudedAreaSolid). An importing application is allowed to check for the existence of the profile name: in case of identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and possible non geometric IfcProfileProperties have to be used.

### Type Body Geometry

The IfcColumnType may define the shared geometric representation for all column occurrences. The RepresentationMaps attribute refers to a list of IfcRepresentationMap's, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with IfcShapeRepresentation's having an RepresentationIdentifier 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It is only applicable if the IfcColumnType has only occurrences of type IfcColumn (See geometric use definition of IfcColumn for further information).

> NOTE  If the IfcColumnType has an associated IfcMaterialProfileSet, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE  The product shape representations are defined as RepresentationMaps (attribute of the supertype IfcTypeProduct), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an IfcMappedItem. See IfcTypeProduct for further information.

> NOTE  The values of attributes RepresentationIdentifier and RepresentationType of IfcShapeRepresentation are restricted in the same way as those for IfcColumn and IfcColumnStandardCase
